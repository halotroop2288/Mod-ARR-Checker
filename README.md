# ARR-Checker
This mod prints an evaluation of the license for all mods being loaded to the console. <br/>
It will try to warn the user of all mods that may not be free to use, or open-license,
or ones that use a custom license, [which is believed by many to be a bad practice](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1445/how-can-a-crayon-license-be-a-problem).
(One that I have been guilty of.)

## Why?
This is useful for creating modpacks that you intend to release publicly,
because it reduces the chance of legal issues and arguments between you and deveolopers. <br/>
I also personally don't like using all rights reserved mods, because I like to look at their code a lot,
and I believe it's a bad practice to hide or restrict access to code. <br/>
One might also feel safer knowing they could read through the source code any time they like,
to dispell their anxieties that there might be malware hidden inside.
